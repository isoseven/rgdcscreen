# How to use
- Open the app
- The **green and red buttons** will increase/decrease the timer. This timer saves across instances, so you only need to set it one time.
- Pressing **Start** will immediately switch the screen to Duplicate and start counting down the timer.
- After the timer runs out, the screen will return to Extend and reset to its previous value.
- The "Hx of tooth" button presses F2 and F1 when toggled on and off respectively.
